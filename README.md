# Overcoming ecological feedbacks in seagrass restoration

A repository for R code, scripts and data from the manuscript "Overcoming ecological feedbacks in seagrass restoration", which used field and laboratory experiments to investigate key ecological feedbacks in seagrass (Zostera marina) restoration by testing the role of hessian bags and seed burial in reducing seed predation and promoting plant development. We used a double-hurdle model approach to predict “seagrass emergence success” and “seagrass growth success” across planted field plots.
